In this Project we have given an API "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos". We have to show the data present in the API and perform 3 action post, delete and update method.

For showing all the tasks, I have created a state called "data" and store all the tasks to "data" state.
With the help of map function I iterate on all the task and dispay the title of task.
